== Introduction and Goals
In this project it is all about building a Interpreter for the esolang asdf. The goal is to interpret asdf to java code, that can be easily run by the jdk.
I have done this, because asdf is similar to brainfuck and as such easy to understand.

| Enable the user to give the program its own code | Interpret the input through the command line.
